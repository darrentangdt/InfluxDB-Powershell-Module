# InfluxDB-Powershell-Module
Powershell module to deal with InfluxDB. It requires powershell 3+ because it uses invoke-webrequest cmdlet.

If you are using an earlier version you can use yukisagi approach:

(I have been using it in all my powershell 2.0 servers and works like charm)

I have also published my advanced monitoring scripts which are the collectors of these grafana dashboards: https://grafana.net/users/micelshima/dashboards
